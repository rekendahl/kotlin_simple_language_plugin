# Kotlin - Simple Language Plugin

This is a reimplementation of JetBrains [Java - Simple Language Plugin](http://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/tutorials/custom_language_support_tutorial.html)
with the additon of using Gradle and the "[gradle-intellij-plugin wizard](https://github.com/shiraji/intellij-plugin-with-gradle-wizard)".

This Project is meant to get someone up to speed developing plugins and follow the same chapter breakdown as JetBrain's Java Plugin. So take a look at the following chapters:

1. [Prerequisites](docs/prerequisites.md)
2. [Language and File Type](docs/language_and_filetype.md)
